## The SINBA algorithm is designed and prototyped with MATLAB, USRP and phased arrays.

This repository contains the source codes for the following paper:

Yi Zhang, Kartik Patel, Sanjay Shakkottai, and Robert W. Heath Jr.. 2019.
Side-information-aided Non-coherent Beam Alignment Design for Millimeter
Wave Systems. In MobiHoc '19: The Twentieth ACM International Symposium on
Mobile Ad Hoc Networking and Computing, July 02-05, 2019, Catania, Italy.
ACM, New York, NY, USA, 10 pages. \[[Link][Paper_Link]\]

In particular, this repository contains the experimental validation and
numerical simulation of the contribution of the above paper. Details of the
method, experimental results, and representative numerical results can be
also found in the above paper.

This software was developed at the [Department of Electrical and Computer
Engineering][UT_ECE], [The University of Texas at Austin][UT_Austin]
and is released under the MIT license.

The software was developed and tested using Matlab R2017b, and uses
[SparsePR][SparsePR], a Matlab software package for solving the sparse
phase retrieval problem, and [TFOCS][tfocs], a Matlab software package
for the efficient construction and solution of convex optimization problems.
A copy of the sparsepr package is included under the third party software
directory at "_Numerical_Simulation/3rd_software_component/_". A selection
of scripts also uses the [CVX][cvx] optimization software, the Generalized
Approximate Message Passing ([GAMP][GAMP]) in MRI MATLAB package and the
[CoSaMP/OMP toolbox][OMP].


## Directory Structure and Contents

The software package is organized under the following directory structure:
- `Experimental_Validation/`
     - `data/`
       - `cal_data/` - 
              This folder contains the collected data which will be used to
              calibrate the antennas, i.e. calculating the radiation gain
              and phase error of each antenna element of a phased array.
       - `cal_result/` - 
              This folder contains the calibration result after running the
              functions in [Experimental_Validation/main_programs/
              fine_phased_array_calibration/].
       - `val_cal_data/` - 
              This folder contains the collected data which will be used to
              validate the proposed calibration method by testing the

       - `cal_decoder/` - 
              This folder contains the specific decoder to decode the
              collected calibration data to check more details of the
              performance of the proposed calibration methods.
       - `fine_phased_array_calibration/` - 
              This folder contains the main scripts for calculating the
              radiation gain and the phase error of the phase shifters of a
              phased array.

              This folder contains the general transmitter to run the
              testbed.
       - `measurement_collection/` - 
              This folder contains the specific receiver to collect
              measurements for validating the proposed calibration methods
              and the non-coherent beam alignment algorithm.
